Name: Ethereum Workshop #3

Version: 1.0

## Description

The main files of this project are a library (contracts/StringMap2.sol), contract (contracts/User.sol), and test (test/user.js). 

The library can do four things: insert, delete, check string values, and iterate through the mapping. 

Some code was adapted from: https://github.com/chriseth/solidity-examples/blob/master/iterable_mapping.sol

## Motivation

This is my first Solidity project, which was created for learning purposes.
